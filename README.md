### 👨‍💻 A little about me

Hi! I’m **Sohan Meghraj**, a curious mind and final-year B.Tech student who’s always been fascinated by how tech can shape the world. I love building things — whether it’s a cool little website, an AI model, or an AR experiment that makes people go “whoa.”

Right now, I’m:
- 🌱 Learning more about **Generative AI**, **Unity AR**, and full-stack development  
- 🔐 Built a mini-project where users log in using images instead of passwords — because security can be creative too  
- 💼 Exploring internship opportunities (even in sales — I'm up for the challenge!)  
- 🤝 Always open to collaborate on meaningful projects  

Outside of tech, I’ve done some anchoring, volunteered for campus events, and I really enjoy connecting with new people. Optimistic by nature, driven by learning.
